Autism Detection Using Machine Learning (Python, ML)

-Developed a machine learning model to predict autism risk based on questionnaire-based behavioral data.

-Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing responses.

-Implemented classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.

-Evaluated performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

-Visualized feature importance using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
